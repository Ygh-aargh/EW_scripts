Hwre are some primitive scripts that I use to play Edgeworld semi-automatically. These scripts are meant to work under Linux. No Windows version will be made in any foreseensble future.

It is highly unlikely that these scripts will work for anyone just out-of-the-box without any customizations. Everything here depends on
* Base layout (position of certain building),
* Browser type and configuration (window size, font sizes, presence of toolbars, ...),
* Window setting (sizes of decorations and fonts on title bar),
* Screen resolution (in my case it's 1920x1080).
